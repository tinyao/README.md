### 👋 Hi there 

I am a solution architect at [JackMa Foundation](https://www.jackmafoundation.org.cn) in Hangzhou. Previously, I worked at Alibaba as an Android developer. In the past 3 years, I turned to work on digital products and solutions for the non-profit programs (mainly focus on rural educations).
